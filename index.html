            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education can be thought of as the transmission of the values and
                accumulated knowledge of a society. In this sense, it is equivalent to what social scientists term
                socialization or enculturation. Children whether conceived among New Guinea tribespeople, the
                Renaissance Florentines, or the middle classes of Manhattan are born without culture. Education is
                designed to guide them in learning a culture, molding their behaviour in the ways of adulthood, and
                directing them toward their eventual role in society. In the most primitive cultures, there is often
                little formal learning little of what one would ordinarily call school or classes or teachers. Instead,
                the entire environment and all activities are frequently viewed as school and classes, and many or all
                adults act as teachers. As societies grow more complex, however, the quantity of knowledge to be passed
                on from one generation to the next becomes more than any one person can know, and, hence, there must
                evolve more selective and efficient means of cultural transmission. The outcome is formal education the
                school and the specialist called the teacher.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The term education can be applied to primitive cultures only in the
                sense of enculturation, which is the process of cultural transmission. A primitive person, whose culture
                is the totality of his
                universe, has a relatively fixed sense of cultural continuity and timelessness. The model of life is
                relatively static
                and absolute, and it is transmitted from one generation to another with little deviation. As for
                prehistoric education, it
                can only be inferred from educational practices in surviving primitive cultures. The purpose of
                primitive education is thus
                to guide children to becoming good members of their tribe or band. There is a marked emphasis upon
                training for citizenship,
                because primitive people are highly concerned with the growth of individuals as tribal members and the
                thorough comprehension of
                their way of life during passage from prepuberty to postpuberty.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Egyptian culture and education were preserved and controlled chiefly by
                the priests, a powerful intellectual elite in the Egyptian theocracy who also served as the political
                bulwarks by preventing cultural diversity. The humanities as well as such practical subjects as science,
                medicine, mathematics, and geometry were in the hands of the priests, who taught in formal schools.
                Vocational skills relating to such fields as architecture, engineering, and sculpture were generally
                transmitted outside the context of formal schooling.

                Egyptians developed two types of formal schools for privileged youth under the supervision of
                governmental officials and priests: one for scribes and the other for priest trainees. At the age of 5,
                pupils entered the writing school and continued their studies in reading and writing until the age of 16
                or 17. At the age of 13 or 14 the schoolboys were also given practical training in offices for which
                they were being prepared. Priesthood training began at the temple college, which boys entered at the age
                of 17; the length of training depending upon the requirements for various priestly offices. </p>
